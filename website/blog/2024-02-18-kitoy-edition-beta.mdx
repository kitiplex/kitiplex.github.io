Hey everyone. I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you all! The documentation landscape is about to undergo a transformation with the introduction of ````Kitoy Edition Beta```` â€” a release that places a strong focus on how this website behaves in preparation for the Next Big Thing. {/* truncate */}

### What's this?

In the ever-evolving tech landscape, being ahead of the curve is crucial. We are gearing up to set a new standard with a heightened emphasis on how the website behaves in anticipation of the Next Big Thing. This release is a testament to our commitment to staying at the forefront of innovation.

### Algolia Search

__Big thanks to Algolia!__ One of the standout features in this release is the integration of [**Algolia search**](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). We know how crucial it is for users to quickly find the information they need, and Algolia's powerful search and discovery API makes that happen. It's a game-changer for enhancing the user experience, aligning seamlessly with our focus on preparing for the future. In this release, we utilize the [default configuration](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/templates#docusaurus-v3-template) with a little bit of tweak.

### Running Optional with Custom Configuration

Flexibility has always been a priority for us. We're introducing the concept of running optional with custom configuration. It's about giving you the control to make your workflow as efficient as possible, aligning perfectly with our goal of preparing for what comes next.


Thank you for your time.
