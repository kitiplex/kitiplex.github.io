## Fundamentals

:::info
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a powerful connection between the concepts of derivatives and integrals, making it a cornerstone in the study of calculus. It enables the calculation of definite integrals by finding antiderivatives and vice versa, offering a more efficient way to compute certain types of integrals.


:::

### First Fundamental Theorem

Let $f$ be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and let $F$ be the function defined by:

$$
F(x)= \int_{a}^{x}f(t) dt.
$$

Then, $F$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $[a, b]$, and $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in $(a, b)$.

In simpler terms, if $f$ is a continuous function, and $F$ is the accumulation (or antiderivative) of $f$, then the derivative of $F$ is $f$.

### Second Fundamental Theorem

Let $f$ be a real-valued function defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, and let $F$ be any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$. Then,

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) 
$$

In other words, the definite integral of a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is equal to the difference between the antiderivative $F$ evaluated at \( b \) and $F$ evaluated at $a$.






:::tip

Let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$.
Then $F$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$,
$F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.

The expression you provided is a mathematical notation representing an integral. Specifically, it represents the integral of the function sin(x) with respect to x, evaluated from 0 to 2π.

In simpler terms, it means you are calculating the area under the curve of the function sin(x) over the interval from 0 to 2π. The integral sign (∫) signifies the mathematical operation of integration, while sin(x) represents the function being integrated.

To evaluate this integral, you would need to perform the integration calculation. In the case of the given function sin(x), the integral can be evaluated as:


$I = [-cos(x)]$ evaluated from 0 to $2π$

Substituting the limits of integration into the evaluated expression would yield the specific numerical value of the integral.

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
