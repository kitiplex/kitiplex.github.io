**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**  
Let $f:[a,b] \to \R$ be Riemann integrable. Let $F:[a,b]\to\R$ be $F(x)=
\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$.
Then $$F$$ is continuous, and at all $x$ such that $f$ is continuous at $x$,
$F$ is differentiable at $x$ with $F'(x)=f(x)$.


The expression you provided is a mathematical notation representing an integral. Specifically, it represents the integral of the function sin(x) with respect to x, evaluated from 0 to 2π.

In simpler terms, it means you are calculating the area under the curve of the function sin(x) over the interval from 0 to 2π. The integral sign (∫) signifies the mathematical operation of integration, while sin(x) represents the function being integrated.

To evaluate this integral, you would need to perform the integration calculation. In the case of the given function sin(x), the integral can be evaluated as:

I = [-cos(x)] evaluated from 0 to 2π

Substituting the limits of integration into the evaluated expression would yield the specific numerical value of the integral.

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$
