Docusaurus would never be what it is today without the huge contributions from these folks who have moved on to bigger and greater things.

<!-- ## Student Fellows {#student-fellows}

A handful of students have also worked on Docusaurus as part of their school term/internship and the [Major League Hacking Fellowship program](https://fellowship.mlh.io/), contributing amazing features such as plugin options validation, migration tooling, and a Bootstrap theme.
